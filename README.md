# Projects Application

## Objective

This project is in order to bring some basic concepts to SdGarcia about angularjs and front end development.

## Synopsis

You will have a list of projects each project has the same details, (this is almost equal to other application in the repo call directory list). The idea is to make it grow oriented to projects, clients, and products.

## Instalation

In order to install you will need nodejs and npm.

Then run the following command:

$ npm install

## Implementation

Ths application has different environments. You can start development with the following command:

$ gulp

Code is source mapped, watched and in sync with the browser to start developing. So any change you do to source will be shown in real time during your development.
